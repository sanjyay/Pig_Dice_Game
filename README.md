#### The objective of the game is that at the end of the game which player has most points is declared the winner . The number appearing on the dice is added to the player's total score. Each player gets to roll the dice as many times as they wish but the catch here is,if a player gets 1 then their turn is over and their score is set to be 0 irrespective of whatever they might have scored before getting a 1 on the dice.
